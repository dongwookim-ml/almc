% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% ================= IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS =======================
% Questions regarding the SIGS styles, SIGS policies and
% procedures, Conferences etc. should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti (griscti@acm.org)
%
% Technical questions _only_ to
% Gerald Murray (murray@hq.acm.org)

%\subtitle{[Extended Abstract]
%\titlenote{A full version of this paper is available as
%\textit{Author's Guide to Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using
%\LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX} at
%\texttt{www.acm.org/eaddress.htm}}}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
%\section{Acknowledgments}
%This section is optional; it is a location for you
%to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
%what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
%authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
%his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
%and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{cikm2016}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional
%\balancecolumns
\appendix
\input{appendix}
\input{appendix_composition}
%%Appendix A
%\section{Headings in Appendices}
%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%\subsection{Introduction}
%\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%\subsubsection{Math Equations}
%\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%\paragraph{Display Equations}
%\subsubsection{Citations}
%\subsubsection{Tables}
%\subsubsection{Figures}
%\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
%\subsection{Conclusions}
%\subsection{Acknowledgments}
%\subsection{Additional Authors}
%This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%You just add the names and information in the
%\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
%of the document.
%\subsection{References}
%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%the .tex source file and comment out
%the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
%% This next section command marks the start of
%% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
%\section{More Help for the Hardy}
%The sig-alternate.cls file itself is chock-full of succinct
%and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
%experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
%it useful but please remember not to change it.
